      summary: Unprotected user login
      description: |
        This endpoint allows a user to log in by providing their email and password. 
        If the credentials are valid, a JWT token is generated and stored in an `unprotectedCookie` cookie, 
        which is sent back to the client. The cookie will last for one hour and is configured with the `httpOnly` 
        option to prevent unauthorized access from the browser. 
        If the user does not exist or the password is incorrect, the server will return an appropriate error message. 
        This functionality is designed for an unprotected authentication flow, meaning it does not require role-based 
        authorization or access validation.
